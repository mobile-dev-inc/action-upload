# mobile.dev Upload Action

Upload your app to mobile.dev for analysis.

# Triggers

Trigger this action on (1) pushes to your main branch and (2) pull requests opened against your main branch:


```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
```

If you need to use the `pull_request_target` trigger to support repo forks, check out the HEAD of the pull request to ensure that you're running the mobile.dev analysis against the changed code:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request_target:
    branches: [ master ]
jobs:
  upload-to-mobile-dev:
    name: Upload build to mobile.dev
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }} # Checkout PR HEAD
```

# Android

```yaml
- uses: mobile-dev-inc/action-upload@v3.0.1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.MOBILE_DEV_API_KEY }}
    app-file: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

`app-file` should point to an x86 compatible APK file

### Proguard Deobfuscation

Include the Proguard mapping file to deobfuscate Android performance traces:

```yaml
- uses: mobile-dev-inc/action-upload@v3.0.1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.MOBILE_DEV_API_KEY }}
    app-file: app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
    mapping-file: app/build/outputs/mapping/release/mapping.txt
```

# iOS

```yaml
- uses: mobile-dev-inc/action-upload@v3.0.1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.MOBILE_DEV_API_KEY }}
    app-file: <app_name>.app
    mapping-file: <app_name>.app.dSYM
```

`app-file` should point to an x86 compatible Simulator build packaged in a `zip` archive or an iOS `.app` file

`mapping-file` should point to generated .dSYM file (unique per build). more info [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/building-your-app-to-include-debugging-information). 

# Custom workspace location

By default, the action is looking for a `.mobiledev` folder with Maestro flows in the root directory of the project. If you would like to customize this behaviour, you can override it with a `workspace` argument:

```yaml
- uses: mobile-dev-inc/action-upload@v3.0.1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.MOBILE_DEV_API_KEY }}
    app-file: app.zip
    workspace: myApp/.mobiledev
```

# Custom name
A name will automatically be provided according to the following order:
1. If it is a Pull Request, use Pull Request title as name
2. If it is a normal push, use commit message as name
3. If for some reason the commit message is not available, use the commit SHA as name

If you want to override this behaviour and specify your own name, you can do so by setting the `name` argument:

```yaml
- uses: mobile-dev-inc/action-upload@v3.0.1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.MOBILE_DEV_API_KEY }}
    app-file: app.zip
    workspace: myApp/.mobiledev
    name: customName
```


# Run in async mode
If you don't want the action to wait until the Upload has been completed as is the default behaviour, set the `async` argument to `true`:

```yaml
- uses: mobile-dev-inc/action-upload@v3.0.1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.MOBILE_DEV_API_KEY }}
    app-file: app.zip
    async: true
```
